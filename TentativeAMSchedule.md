# Tentative AM Schedule

First Morning session - "Self-Advocacy for Software Folks:" A look at how people who develop code can avoid the second author trap and successfully advocate for themselves and their personnel. What does a good collaboration that rewards both empirical and software work look like? What advice would you give to a grad student or postdoc balancing software development with biology? 

Second morning session: "Sustainable scientific software development for large and distributed teams:" How can developers set up workflows to keep software standards high, but without devoting 100% of their time to development. JoÃ«lle Barido-Sottani will present a case study from the development team at RevBayes.
