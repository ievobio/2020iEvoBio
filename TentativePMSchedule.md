# Tentative PM Schedule

Afternoon Session 1 - "Inclusive pedagogy for the computational evolutionary biologist." What is inclusive pedagogy? How can educators leverage active learning to increase Breanna Harris and April Wright will present some lessons learned from their classrooms, and from writing their recent manuscript "[From Panic to Pedagogy: Using online active learning to promote inclusive instruction in ecology and evolutionary biology courses.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.6915)"

Afternoon Session 2 -  "Coding to learn, not learning to code." In this session, we will discuss scaffolding computation into courses that aren't inherently computational themselves. For example, using R to process camera trap data in a mammalogy course, or using population genetic simulations in evolution. What are the major challenges to doing this? Is domain knowledge lost? **Interested parties are welcome to enter their course to be showcased during this session. A showcase will be a 5-minute discussion of what you're doing in your class to code-to-learn. If interested, please open an issue here*

Afternoon mixer: Course-based breakouts. We'll form breakouts to discuss topics from the afternoon sessions.
